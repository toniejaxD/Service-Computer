1) Connecting to an Oracle database: The application connects to an Oracle database using a connection string containing information about the server, database ID, and user credentials.

2) Data display: Data from certain tables in the database are retrieved and displayed in the application using the DataGridView control.

3) XML data import and export: Allows you to export data to XML files and import data from XML files into the database.

4) Record management: The application allows records to be deleted from various tables in the database, which is useful for managing service data.
